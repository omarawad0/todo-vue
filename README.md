# Todo App


## Technical starting point

Our team was already able to complete the following:

- Add `Vuex` and create a default store.
- Add [Axios HTTP Client](https://2x.antdv.com/docs/vue/introduce/) for API calls.
- Add [AntDesignVue](https://2x.antdv.com/docs/vue/introduce/) for UI components.

## Mission

- [x] Fork/Clone this repository into your account.
- [x] Create a named `vuex` module to hold your todos.
- [x] Do all your business logic, API Calls, inside the folder named `core`.
- [x] Complete the CRUD features in the GUI and make sure they are reflected in the `vuex` store.
- [x] Write concise commit messages.


## Bonus
- [x] Add [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)


## Please note

- Pay attention to your code style and structure, don't ignore the eslint hints.
- Design your Vue components: use props, slots and whatever you need to keep your code clean.
- Don't reinvent the wheel, use `AntDesignVue` components when possible.
- Don't pay special attention for responsive design.

## Feel free to

- Improve the design to have better UI and UX.
- Re-organize the codebase.
- Use TypeScript.
- Create new modules/methods/components.

- Edit `README.md` to add documentation.
